Problem statement:
In traditional supply chains, lack of transparency, counterfeiting, and ethical concerns often plague the industry. Consumers, stakeholders, and regulatory bodies struggle to verify the authenticity, journey, and ethical practices behind products. There's a need for a solution that enhances transparency, reduces fraud, and ensures fair labor practices throughout the supply chain.


This project demonstrates by registering each product on the blockchain and utilizing smart contracts to record its journey, quality checks, and interactions, VeriChain ensures that stakeholders have access to trustworthy and tamper-proof information in real time.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
#install next.js
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest

#install hardhat, ether.js version 5.7.2 and web3modal version 1.9.12
npm i hardhat
npm i ethers@5.7.2
npm i web3modal@1.9.12

#testing hardhat 
npx hardhat node

#deploy the smartcontract to localhost
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
```
